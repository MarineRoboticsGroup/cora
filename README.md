# CORA++

This is an efficient C++ implementation of the certifiably correct range-aided
SLAM algorithm (CORA). Please see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11614)
for more details.

## Usage

*TODO*: write up usage after we have a working version.


## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

This implementation largely follows the structure of the
[SE-Sync C++ implementation](https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync).
